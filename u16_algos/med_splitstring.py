# Scenario 3: Extracting Product IDs from a Manufacturing System Log

# You are working with a manufacturing system that records 
# product IDs in a single string. However, instead of using 
# a single-character delimiter, the system separates product 
# IDs using a multi-character delimiter (///).

# Your task is to:
# (1) Extract individual product IDs from the raw string and store them in a list.
# (2) Convert each extracted ID into an integer for further processing.
